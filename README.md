# Optimized-ResNet-Benchmark-Suite
I have optimized the Tango benchmark suite written in pure CUDA language to get faster execution. Different Deep Neural Network architectures like ResNet, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, CifarNet have been written in pure CUDA. I have optimized the ResNet benchmark suite using various optimization techniques to make it efficient.
